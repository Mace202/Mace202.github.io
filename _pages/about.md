My name is Mason Springfield, and I am a mathematician specializing in number theory. Welcome to my website, please have a look around!

You can find my contact information at the top of my CV page. My preferred method of contact is email, but I will also respond to calls/ texts.

In my free time I enjoy reading, building models, and playing board/ video games.

Pardon my mess as I get the site fully up and running!
